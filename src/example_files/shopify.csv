<p>Hey men, now you can finally enjoy the pumpkin spice scent without having to pour a latte on your beard! No yoga pants or Uggs required here.</p>
<p>Texas Beard Company Beard Balm is has similar properties and benefits to our all natural beard oils. It will help keep your hair healthy, strong, and manageable.</p>
<p>In addition to oils we blend in naturally deodorized Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, and Coconut oil. We use naturally deodorized butters because you don't want your balm to smell like chocolate!</p>
<p>Unlike other balms on the market, our balm is not thick and hard like a wax. Our balm is whipped which gives it a smooth creamy consistency. This is much more labor intensive and time consuming, but it's worth it to have a better product.</p>
<p>Comes in a 2oz tin.</p>
